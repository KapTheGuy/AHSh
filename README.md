# AHSh

Advanced Hybrid Shell or AHSh for short, is a simple shell that you can use on Linux or port to an OS you made.

## Why???

"Why does this exist?" you might ask, well, I (stupd) am designing this shell for AHK which you could find [here](https://github.com/Libre-X-Project/AHK-main). You might also ask "Why do I need this?", the thing is, you don't! This shell caters to a specific group of people (osdevs) and not the average consumer.
